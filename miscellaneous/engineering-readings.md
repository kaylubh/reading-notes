## Discussion Questions

1. **What’s the one thing I bring to this career (and a potential employer) that nobody else can?**

    While there are far too many people in the world to definitively say I possess a skill that nobody else has, I believe that my best asset to bring to this career is my diverse experiences from prior work and a habit for looking at situations from multiple perspectives to get a more objective view.

1. **What are 3 things I’ll start doing to “un-stick” myself whenever I get stuck on tough piece of code, logic, or feature?**

    1. Follow a framework to approach a problem and solve it systemically instead of trying different approaches until one works
    1. Divide and conquer; break down whatever I'm working on into smaller pieces so I can better understand it, reach solutions quicker, and be motivated by success to tackle the next smaller problem
    1. Try to understand the why behind what I am trying to do and the why behind the unexpected result, then use this information to trace back to the issue with my implementation
