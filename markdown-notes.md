## About

## Syntax
### Headings
Headings are created using the `#` symbol in front of the text you want to create as a heading. There are 6 levels of headings, denoted by the number of `#` symobls in front of the text. The largest heading is created using one `#` symbol and the smallest heading is created using 6 `#` symbols.
>```# Heading``` creates the largest heading:
># Heading
>```###### Heading``` creates the smallest heading:
>###### Heading
#
### Text
Text can be formatted in several different ways to bring attention to content or create a desired effect.
#### **Bold**
To make text bold you use either a double asterisk `**` or double underscore `__` before and after the text. While either method can be used, it is recommended to only use the double asterisks `**` because of the way some applications process underscores `__` might result in your content being displayed incorrectly.
>```**Bolded Text**```
>
>**Bolded Text**
#### *Italics*
To make text italicized you use either an asterisk `*` or underscore `_` before and after the text. While either method can be used, it is recommended to only use the asterisk `*` because of the way some applications process underscores `_` might result in your content being displayed incorrectly.
>```*Italicized Text*```
>
>*Italicized Text*
#
### Links
A link is created in two parts. First the content you want to be displayed for link is wrapped in square brackets `[]`. This is immediately followed by where the link should go wrapped in parentheses `()`.
>```[This is a link to this page](https://kaylubh.github.io/reading-notes/markdown-notes.html)```
>
>[This is a link to this page](https://kaylubh.github.io/reading-notes/markdown-notes.html)

### Lists
#### Unordered (Bulleted)
An unordered, or bulleted, list is created using the `-` dash, `*` asterisk, or `+` plus symbols and a space before the content on each bullet in the list.
>```
>- Item 1   * Item 1    + Item 1
>- Item 2   * Item 2    + Item 2
>- Item 3   * Item 3    + Item 3
>```
>- Item 1   
>- Item 2
>- Item 3
#### Ordered (Numbered)
An ordered, or numbered, list is created using a number and a period `1.` before the content.
>```
>1. Item 1
>2. Item 2
>3. Item 3
>```
>1. Item 1
>2. Item 2
>3. Item 3
