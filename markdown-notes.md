### Headings
Headings are created using the `#` symbol in front of the text you want to create as a heading. There are 6 levels of headings, denoted by the number of `#` symobls in front the text. The largest heading is created using one `#` symbol and the smallest heading is created using 6 `#` symbols.
>```# Heading``` creates the largest heading:

### Text

### Links
A link is created in two parts. First the content you want to be displayed for link is wrapped in square brackets `[]`. This is immediately followed by where the link should go wrapped in parantheses `()`.
