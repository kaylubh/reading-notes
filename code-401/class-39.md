# React Context

## Reading Questions

1. **What is React Context, and how does it help in managing state and data sharing in a React application?**

    React context enables sharing of data across multiple components without requiring the data to be shared via props. This makes it simpler to share a common state or required piece of data across a whole application or large part of an application such as setting a theme or providing user data.

1. **Explain the useContext Hook and how it can be used to access data from a React Context within a functional component.**

    The useContext hook is used to retrieve the context from a context provider defined in an ancestor of the component. After retrieving the context it can be used like any other variable in the component similarly to a prop.

## Things I want to know more about

- Best practices for using context
- Are there any differences in passing something as context instead of a prop
