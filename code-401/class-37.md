# Next.js and Tailwind CSS Intro

## Reading Questions

1. **After reading “Tailwind in 15 minutes,” can you describe the purpose of utility classes in Tailwind CSS and provide an example of how to use them to style an HTML element?**

    Utility classes in Tailwind CSS allow you to add a large amount of styling to HTML elements using pre-defined classes directly in the HTML instead of having to create your own CSS rules.

    ```html
    ...
    <p class="p-4">Lorem ipsum...</p>
    ...
    ```

    In this example, adding a class of `p-4` adds padding of 4rem on an element.

1. **Based on “Why to use Next.js,” explain the main advantages of using Next.js for web development, and provide a brief comparison between traditional client-side rendering and Next.js’s server-side rendering approach.**

    Next.js is used as a framework for a React application to allow for server-side rendering of the web pages which can increase performance or make it simpler to dynamically render data. Additionally, Next.js provides development tools that makes it easier to work with and build React applications.
