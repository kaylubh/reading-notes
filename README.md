## **Growth Mindset**
### What It Is to Me
I don't like long winded paragraphs so lets keep this *short* and *sweet*. 
#### A growth mindset is:
- Knowing that you can learn and develop no matter your current situation or starting point
- Accepting that obstacles and challenges are part of the learning process and ~~almost~~ any project
- Viewing your efforts toward something as a valuable contribution to your desired goals
- Receiving feedback from yourself and others to enable personal growth and accomplishment
### How Do I Keep a Growth Mindset
1. Remind myself to focus on bigger picture, don't let small details stop me in my tracks
2. Recognize that while true perfection is rarely attainable, striving for it is a worthy endeavor
3. Create motivation from the small accoplishments while maintaining an optimistic outlook
4. Understand that feedback, especially the critical kind, is merely a growth opportunity and not a definitive judgement of my abilities or potential

### Bio
Welcome to my little notes page! I live in the Raleigh, North Carolina area or you may also know the greater metropolitan area as the Research Triange Park (RTP). Currently employed in the retail industry while I work towards a long held passion for web and software development as a student at [Code Fellows](https://www.codefellows.org/) and a little self-study. Looking forward to furthering my learning and applying my newfound skills in a position with which I can use the infinite potential of computing to leave a positive impact on humanity.
