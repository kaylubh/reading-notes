# CSS Transitions, Transforms, and Animations

## CSS Transforms

1. **What does a CSS transform allow the developer to do to an element?**

    CSS transform allows you to distort an element along 2 or 3 dimensions to adjust the visual appearance of the element. You could use this to do things like rotate, scale, or skew an element.

2. **Provide an example of a transform and how you could see that being used on a website.**

    Transform styling could be used to bring attention to a certain part of a website such as featured content or to provide a visual indication of a notification to a user.

2. **How does a CSS animation differ from a CSS transition?**

    A CSS transition adjusts an elements appearance from the beginning state to the end state. An animations allows you to set multiple states of appearance from beginning to end and as many as desired in between.
