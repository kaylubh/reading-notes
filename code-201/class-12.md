## JavaScript Canvas

1. **What does the `<canvas>` allow a developer to achieve?**

    The `<canvas>` element allows a developer to draw 2D graphics on a web page using JavaScript.

2. **What is the importance of the closing `</canvas>` tag?**

    The content between the opening and closing tags is what will be displayed should the browser or device not support the `<canvas>` element. Without the closing tag, the user would not see this fallback content.
