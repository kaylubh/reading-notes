# Debugging

## Troubleshooting JavaScript

1. **Name some key differences between a Syntax Error and a Logic Error.**

    Syntax errors are things like spelling or missing syntax like a semicolon that prevent the program from running and are usually easy to solve. Logic errors happen when the program runs but produces incorrect or unintended results, these errors can be harder to identify the source and solve.

2. **List a few types of errors that you have encountered in past lab assignments and explain how you were able to correct them.**

    - Forgot to call a function; added a call for the function
    - When using the `appendChild` method on the DOM I tried to append an element to itself instead of the parent element

3. **How will this topic continue to influence your long term goals?**

    Troubleshooting and debugging are tasks that I will likely constantly be encountering in a software development positions. I need to learn about common errors and develop skills on how to efficiently debug in order to be a proficient developer.

## The JavaScript Debugger

1. **How would you describe the JavaScript Debugger tool and how it works to someone just starting out in software development?**

    The JavaScript debugger tool can be used to see the value of variables and use breakpoints to pause execution of the code to find problems. You can also see how what code has been executed up until a breakpoint and see the scope of variables.

2. **Define what a breakpoint is.**

    A breakpoint is a line of the code where you want to pause execution of the code to help identify problems.

3. **What is the call stack?**

    The call stack shows you all code that has been executed up until the breakpoint at a given line.
