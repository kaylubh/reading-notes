# HTML Links, JS Functions, and Intro to CSS Layout

## Learn HTML: Creating Hyperlinks

1. **To create a basic link, we wrap text or other content inside what element?**

    The anchor element `<a>`

2. **The href attribute contains what information?**

    The hypertext reference attribute `href` contains the web address

3. **What are some ways we can ensure links on our pages are accessible to all readers?**

    - Use keywords in the link text
    - Don't put the URL in the link text
    - Style links with a different color and a underline

## CSS Layout: Normal Flow CSS Layout: Positioning

1. **What is meant by “normal flow”?**

    Normal flow is the order and layout that content and elements appear on a webpage without adjusting their position using CSS.

2. **What are a few differences between block-level and inline elements?**

    Block level elements take up their on line on the page and their margin will push them away from other elements in all four directions. Inline elements do not take up their on own line and their margin will only affect the left and right sides of their element. You cannot adjust the height and width of an inline element but you can adjust them on a block-level element.

3. **___ positioning is the default for every html element.**

    Static positioning is the default.

4. **Name a few advantages to using absolute positioning on an element.**

    When an element is positioned using absolute positioning it doesn't leave a gap where it was before like in relative positioning. Elements that are absolute positioned exist outside the normal document flow which can be used to create features or elements that don't affect the layout of the rest of the page.

5. **What is a key difference between fixed positioning and absolute positioning?**

    Absolute positioning is relative to the elements ancestor or containing element. Fixed positioning is relative to the viewport.

## Learn JS: Functions – Reusable Blocks of Code

1. **Describe the difference between a function declaration and a function invocation.**

    A function declaration is the block of code which defines what the function will do when it is executed. A function invocation calls the function to execute.

2. **What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?**

    A parameter can be thought of as a placeholder for an argument. Parameters are made when creating the function to specify that the function expects an argument to be passed to it when it is invoked.

## Miscellaneous: Pair Programming

1. **Pick 2 benefits to pair programming and reflect on how these benefits could help you on your coding journey.**

    - **"Learning from fellow students"** By collaborating with a fellow student on the same codebase I could gain insights on different ways to address an obstacle or create a feature. This would also encourage me to develop readable code that others can understand.
    - **Job interview readiness** Pair programming could allow me to practice soft skills that will be necessary to have a successful interview such as teamwork and effectively discussing coding concepts.
