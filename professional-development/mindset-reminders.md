# Mindset Reminders

## Notes

- Deliberate practice: purposely challenging yourself to attempt difficult or new tasks and not just doing what you are already good at
- Not Yet: failing and errors should be viewed as opportunities for growth
- Reward the effort of growth instead of solely focusing on only results when learning
- Grit: maintaining long-term perseverance for long-term goals
- Don't be a snob, don't create a complete judgement of someone based on a small part of them
- Success does not exist without losses and failures

## Emotional Intelligence Self-Assessment

Of the four categories the assessment broke down my results into, my highest scores were in self-awareness and self-management, while my lowest scores were in social awareness and relationship management. These results indicate to me that I do a good job overall with understanding my own emotions and how they impact my life. Conversely, these results let me know that I need to improve my ability to understand others emotions when Iâ€™m interacting with them. I also need to improve my understanding of how my own emotions affect the health and effectiveness of relationships with others.

## Bias Self-Assessment

After taking the bias self assessment I noticed that overall I have a sense of what bias is but I need to improve my abilities to address bias. Of the different sections in the assessment, I scored highest in "CONNECT TO MITIGATE BIAS" and "MEANINGFUL CONNECTIONS". This lets me know that I understand how to connect with others and empathize with them on how bias might affect them. I scored lowest in the "EFFECTIVE COURAGE" and "FOUR WAYS TO ACT" sections. This lets me know that I still have room for improvement on how to personally address bias and support others when they are biased against unfairly.
