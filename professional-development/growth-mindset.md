# **Growth Mindset**

## A Growth Mindset is

- Knowing that you can learn and develop no matter your current situation or starting point
- Accepting that obstacles and challenges are part of the learning process and ~~almost~~ any project
- Viewing your efforts toward something as a valuable contribution to your desired goals
- Receiving feedback from yourself and others to enable personal growth and accomplishment

## How Do I Keep a Growth Mindset

1. Remind myself to focus on the bigger picture, don't let small details stop me in my tracks
2. Recognize that while true perfection is rarely attainable, striving for it is a worthy endeavor
3. Create motivation from the small accomplishments while maintaining an optimistic outlook
4. Understand that feedback, especially the critical kind, is merely a growth opportunity and not a definitive judgement of my abilities or potential
