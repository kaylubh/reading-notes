## 6 Reasons for Pair Programming

1. **What are the 6 reasons for pair programming?**

    1. Greater Efficiency
    2. Engaged Collaboration
    3. Learning
    4. Social Skills
    5. Interview Readiness
    6. Work Environment Readiness

2. **In your experience, which of these reasons have you found most beneficial?**

    I have found learning to be the most beneficial. When working with other classmates, especially when pair programming or seeing their code, I am able to see and learn other ways to approach problems and develop features.

3. **How does pair programming work?**

    Pair programming typically works by having one person be the *Driver* and the other person be the *Navigator*. The driver is the person who handles all the coding and interacting with developing the program. The navigator communicates to the driver to enable and support development. Thinking about the bigger picture, guiding the driver on how to code something, checking documentation, and researching information to determine solutions.
