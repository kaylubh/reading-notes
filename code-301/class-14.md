# Diversity & Inclusion in the Tech Industry

## Consider the history: That Time When Women Stopped Coding

1. **What occurred during the same time as the beginning of the decline of women in computer science?**

    At the same time of this decline, personal computers were beginning to become commonplace in the average home.

2. **Why does it matter that males had been playing on computers growing up?**

    While not strictly learning, interacting with computers from a young age helps you to begin to understand how computers work and have a better initial understanding if you pursue things like computer science. The presence of computers while your growing up also allows you time to know if computer-related career fields are something that interest you instead of having to figure out when you are older.

## Ask the question: Why diversity matters to your tech company

1. **When are diversity efforts most successful?**

    Diversity efforts are most successful when they are considered an important priority by company leadership and supported by the company.

2. **Why do diverse companies perform better?**

    Diverse companies perform better because their teams are made up many different types of people from different backgrounds who all bring unique perspectives and varied experiences in their contributions. This provides more variety in solutions to problems and increased creativity in ideas which results in more successful and more profitable outcomes.

3. **Give an example of how a diverse company can serve a diverse user base or vise-versa.**

    Having a diverse company allows a company to better understand how choices they make might impact different groups or communities of people and use this knowledge to create better products, solutions, etc. If a company has a diverse user base then it allows the company to get more feedback from a bigger group and variety of users use that better feedback to create better outcomes for the company.
